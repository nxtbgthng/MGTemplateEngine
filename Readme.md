About this repository
---------------------

This is an unofficial fork of [MGTemplateEngine](http://mattgemmell.com/2008/05/20/mgtemplateengine-templates-with-cocoa) by [Matt Legend Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com).
Since his original code lies untouched for years on an SVN repo we decided to do an git-svn import to put it on git and add some changes.


What's new in this fork
-----------------------

Here's a list of things we did to the repo. Feel free to have a look at the commits for more details. The changes are rather small.

 * fixed some leaks
 * added a target for a static library to integrade into other projects
